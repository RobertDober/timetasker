Timetasker CLI
==============

Provides a nice command line interface to submit time sheets using [Time
Task](https://timetask.com). This command will submit a single time entry.

The project improves upon a [Chrome
extension](https://github.com/teddywing/chrome-timetasker) that auto-fills the
time sheet form on the website.
