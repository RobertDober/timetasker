Timetasker CLI
==============

Provides a nice command line interface to submit time sheets using [Time
Task][1]. This command will submit a single time entry.

The project vastly improves upon a [Chrome extension][2] that auto-fills the
time sheet form on the website.


## Usage
This will submit a time entry for the "example" project on the current day with
a duration of 7 hours and an empty description:

	$ timetasker --project example

Here we set a custom time of 4.5 hours:

	$ timetasker --project example --time 4.5

Now we specify a date and add a description:

	$ timetasker --project example \
	>     --date 2017-05-31 \
	>     --description "Worked on Timetasker"

And because it's a shell command, we can combine it with other commands. Let's
create a week's worth of time entries starting on Monday May 29th, 2017:

	$ for d in $(ruby -e "require 'date'
	> d = Date.new(2017, 5, 29)
	> (0..4).each { |i| puts (d + i).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }");
	>   do timetasker --project example --date $d;
	> done


## Configuration
Timetasker relies on a configuration file in order to work properly.

If this is your first time running Timetasker, use this command to generate a
skeleton config:

	$ timetasker --write-config

This will generate a `$HOME/.config/timetasker/config.toml` file that looks like
this:

	[auth]
	username = ""
	password_cmd = ""


	[profile]
	person_id = # ADD PERSON ID


	[projects.example]
	client =    # ADD CLIENT ID
	project =   # ADD PROJECT ID
	module =    # ADD MODULE ID
	task = 0
	work_type = # ADD WORK TYPE ID
	billable = true

Fill in the `username` with your TimeTask username. The `password_cmd` should be
a shell command that will output your TimeTask password to STDOUT.

Notice the `[projects.example]` line? That's a project alias. If we, for
instance, changed it to `[projects.my-cool-project]`, we could post a time entry
to that project like this:

	$ timetasker --project my-cool-project

You say you have more than one project? No problem, just copy-paste an
additional `[projects.example]` section and give it a new name.

To fill in the other configuration options, we're going to have to take a trip
to the TimeTask website (relax, we won't be using it much after this).

1. Visit `https://*.timetask.com/time/add/`
2. Fill in a single entry, but don't submit it yet
3. Open the Network console in your browser's developer tools
4. Submit your time entry
5. View the POST request to `https://*.timetask.com/index.php`
6. Take a look at the form data of the request

You should see something like this:

	module:time
	action:submitmultipletime
	f_entryIndexes:0
	f_personID0:111111
	f_clientID0:22222
	f_projectID0:333333
	f_moduleID0:444444
	f_taskID0:0
	f_worktypeID0:555555
	f_date0:04/06/17
	f_time0:7
	f_billable0:t
	f_description0:

Copy the numbers into their corresponding fields in your `config.toml` file.

Once you have a complete config file, you should be all set to start posting
time entries!


Eventually, you'll have to update the `module` value in your configuration file
to align with the current sprint. Instead of visiting the website to get the new
ID of the `module`, the modules of a project can be listed from the program:

	$ timetasker --project example --list-modules

This produces the following output:

	ID        Module
	77777     Sprint 1
	222222    Sprint 2

The correct sprint ID can then be easily copied from this list into
`config.toml`.
