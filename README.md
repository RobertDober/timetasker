Timetasker CLI
==============

## [ABANDONED]
This project has been abandoned. What I wanted was a nice command line interface
to be able to submit time sheets using [Time Task](https://timetask.com), but
the result wasn't really what I had hoped for. Ultimately I didn't see this tool
saving me much more time (if any) compared with using the website.

My idea was to have the executable generate a weekly time sheet as YAML with
prepopulated defaults. This file could then be modified by the user if necessary
and submitted to the website via the CLI tool.

The project is succeeded by a [Chrome
extension](https://github.com/teddywing/chrome-timetasker) that auto-fills the
time sheet form on the website.

Posting this code in the event that it becomes useful to anyone.
